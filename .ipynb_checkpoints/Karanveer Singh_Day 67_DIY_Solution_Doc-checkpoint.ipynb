    "Q1: What is Hyperparameter Optimization, and why do we need it?\n",
    "Hyperparameter optimization is the process of selecting the best set of hyperparameters for a machine learning model to maximize its performance on a specific dataset. Hyperparameters are configuration settings that control the model training process and architecture but are not learned from the data (e.g., learning rate, number of layers, batch size).\n",
