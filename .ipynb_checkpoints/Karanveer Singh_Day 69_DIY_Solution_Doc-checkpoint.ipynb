    "1. How do ensemble techniques work for regression and classification problems?\n",
    "Ensemble techniques combine the predictions of multiple models to improve overall performance. Here's how they work:\n",
    "\n",
    "For Classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "Majority Voting: Each model votes for a class, and the class with the most votes is chosen.\n",
    "Weighted Voting: Each model's vote is weighted based on its accuracy.\n",
    "For Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Averaging: Predictions from all models are averaged to produce the final prediction.\n",
    "Weighted Averaging: Predictions are weighted by model performance.\n",
    "Ensemble techniques reduce overfitting, increase robustness, and improve accuracy. Common methods include Bagging (e.g., Random Forest), Boosting (e.g., XGBoost), and Stacking.\n",

    ". What is the mixing models approach?\n",
    "The mixing models approach, also known as ensemble learning, combines multiple models (weak learners or base models) to form a stronger model. These models can be mixed in different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging: Models are trained independently, and predictions are combined (e.g., Random Forest).\n",
    "Boosting: Models are trained sequentially, correcting errors from previous models (e.g., XGBoost).\n",
    "Stacking: Combines predictions of multiple models using another model (meta-model) to make the final prediction.\n",
    "This approach reduces bias, variance, and improves predictive performance.\n",

    " What is early stopping?\n",
    "Early stopping is a technique used to prevent overfitting during training. It stops the training process when the model's performance on a validation set no longer improves for a specified number of iterations (patience).\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "Monitor a metric (e.g., accuracy, loss) on the validation set.\n",
    "If the metric does not improve for a defined number of iterations, stop training.\n",
    "This saves computational resources and prevents the model from overfitting on the training data."
