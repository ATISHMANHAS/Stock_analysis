    "Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI is a broad field in computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes reasoning, learning, problem-solving, understanding natural language, and perception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML): ML is a subset of AI that involves the development of algorithms that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed for specific tasks, ML models improve their performance as they are exposed to more data.\n",

    "Deep Learning: Deep Learning is a further subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (hence \"deep\") to analyze various types of data, including images, text, and audio. Deep Learning has been particularly successful in tasks such as image and speech recognition due to its ability to automatically learn complex patterns from large datasets.\n",

    "Supervised Learning is a type of ML where the model is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning that each training example is paired with an output label. The algorithm learns to map inputs to the correct outputs based on the training data. The goal is to make accurate predictions or classifications on new, unseen data. Common algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, and support vector machines. Supervised learning is commonly used for tasks like spam detection, sentiment analysis, and image classification."

    "Unsupervised Learning is another type of ML where the model is trained on data that does not have labeled outputs. The goal is to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures within the data. This can involve clustering similar data points together or reducing dimensionality to simplify data representation. Common algorithms include k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA). Unsupervised learning is often used in tasks like customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and exploratory data analysis."

    "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of ML where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. Unlike supervised learning, where the correct output is provided, in RL, the agent learns through trial and error, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on its actions. RL is commonly used in robotics, game playing, and autonomous systems. Algorithms include Q-learning and deep Q-networks (DQN)."
